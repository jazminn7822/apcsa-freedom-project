As I've mentioned earlier on, users can essentially create any web app or website and then host it using Google's Firebase. Therefore, after taking  this into account, reading more about the process in [Deploy a Static Bootstrap Website to Google Firebase](https://betterprogramming.pub/deploying-a-static-bootstrap-website-to-google-firebase-a2eb043ff015) and creating an MVP (Minimm Viable Product) plan for this project, I finally decide to take my chances and work on creating a Bootstrap website for my project idea. 
  In order to get to the desired outcome I wanted, I searched for videos throughout YouTube, and after hours of looking for the video I needed to find, I finally came across [How To Create Responsive Login Form Using HTML & CSS & Bootstrap (2020)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwk-Q_Ua-jM) which eventually helped me tons. I eventually created this website. Below are some screenshots of the code behind the [MyDaily Water Web application](https://jazmin7822.github.io/freedom-project/#)
