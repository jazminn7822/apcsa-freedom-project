As I've mentioned earlier on, users can essentially create any web app or website and then host it using Google's Firebase. Therefore, after taking  this into account, reading more about the process in [Deploy a Static Bootstrap Website to Google Firebase](https://betterprogramming.pub/deploying-a-static-bootstrap-website-to-google-firebase-a2eb043ff015) and creating an MVP (Minimm Viable Product) plan for this project, I finally decide to take my chances and work on creating a Bootstrap website for my project idea. 
  In order to get to the desired outcome I wanted, I searched for videos in YouTube, and after hours of looking for the video I needed to find, I finally came across [How To Create Responsive Login Form Using HTML & CSS & Bootstrap (2020)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwk-Q_Ua-jM) which eventually helped me tons. Before this, I actually had to go back to some Bootstrap lessons I had learned last year to recall on things I had forgotten. For instance, I had to re-learn how to make it so that when the user's mouse hovers over a specific text or shape in the website, the color changes. I also had to re-learn how to add css to my web app in order to make it look more appealing. Additionally, I learned how to make the edges of my box curved by simply adding the class “row no-gutters” which eliminated the sharp edges from the box, and also how to create a shadow for the box that I had by adding a box-shadow with my desired color. I came across [Color Hexa](https://www.colorhexa.com/f5f5dc) and ended up picking out the colors that I wanted for my web app. Something new that I learned was that another way you could control an element’s padding is by using pt-“#” and px-“#”; pt-“#” focuses on the padding-top while px-“#” focuses on the padding for the left and right. I also did  a little research on my own using https://tailwindcss.com/docs/padding to learn about the different ways in which I could control an element’s padding. Eventually, I ended up creating this for my [MyDaily Water Web application](https://jazmin7822.github.io/freedom-project/#) and below are some screenshots of the code behind it.

In regards to the Engineering Design Process, I am in step 4 and step 5. I have been trying to come up with the most promising solution by looking at apps for inspiration on how I want my app to look like after I get the sign in button to work for this web app. I beleive that everything I have been learning in class also  ties back to what I am learning for the project because other than continuing to do do lessons on Edhesive and coding activites, we as students are also trying to plan ways in which we can prepare ourselves for our upcoming AP exam. We have created an MVP plan that will help us focus on what we should be working on depedning on what we're making which not only applies to our freedom project, but also makes an impact in how we manange our time. Some of the skills I have been developing are paying attention to detail and being creative. I have had a lot of fun picking out the colors I wanted my web app to have and just seeing how it came out to be really fascinated me, but I have also leaned to pay attention to detail, as in this case, I was reading through documentations from Bootstrap and trying to recall everything I had learned last year and trying to incoporte it here. Moving on, I will be trying to learn how I could make it possible for the user to sign in and from there on I will have to focus on what are some of the options the user has after thye sign in.
