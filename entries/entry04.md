  As I've mentioned earlier on, users can essentially create any web app or website and then host it using Google's Firebase. Therefore, after taking this into account, reading more about the process of how to [Deploy a Static Bootstrap Website to Google Firebase](https://betterprogramming.pub/deploying-a-static-bootstrap-website-to-google-firebase-a2eb043ff015) and creating an Minimum Viable Product (MVP) plan for this project, I finally decided to take my chances and work on creating a Bootstrap website for my project idea. 
  In order to get to the desired outcome I wanted in creating the sign in page, I searched for videos in YouTube, and after hours of looking for the video I wanted to find, I finally came across [How To Create Responsive Login Form Using HTML & CSS & Bootstrap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwk-Q_Ua-jM) which eventually helped me a lot. Before this, I actually had to go back to some Bootstrap lessons I had learned last year in order to recall things I had forgotten. For instance, I had to re-learn how to make it so that when the user's mouse hovers over a specific text or shape in the web app, the color changed. I also had to re-learn how to add css to my web app in order to make it look more appealing. Additionally, I learned how to make the edges of my box curved by simply adding the class `row no-gutters` which eliminated the sharp edges from the box. I also learnered how to create a shadow for the box that I had by adding a `box-shadow` with the px size I wanted it to have and along with that, my desired color. I came across [Color Hexa](https://www.colorhexa.com/f5f5dc) and ended up picking out the colors that I wanted for the box shadow. Something new that I learned was that another way you could control an element’s padding is by using pt-“#” and px-“#”; pt-“#” focuses on the padding-top while px-“#” focuses on the padding for the left and right. I also did a little research on my own using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/padding) to learn about the different ways in which I could control an element’s padding. Eventually, I ended up creating this for my [MyDaily Water Web application](https://jazmin7822.github.io/freedom-project/#) and below are some screenshots of the code behind it.

   I believe that everything I have been learning in class also ties back to what I am learning for this project because other than continuing to do do lessons on Edhesive and coding activites, we as students have also been trying to plan ways in which we can prepare ourselves for the AP exam. Although we have created an MVP plan for this project, we have essentially also created one in preperation for our AP Exam. Throughout the process of planning my MVP, I realized how many weeks were left and thought to myself about what was the best way I could not only finish creating the web app by the deadline, but also spend time preparing for the exam. In other words, I was looking at how I would be managing my time throught the next couple of weeks/months. 

  Some of the **skills** I have been developing are paying close attention to detail and being creative. I have had a lot of fun working on the css of my web app and also picking out the colors I wanted my web app to have and just seeing how it came out to be really fascinated me, but I have also leaned to pay attention to detail. In this case, I was reading through documentations from Bootstrap, making sure I was spelling things correctly in my code editor, adhering to syntax rules, and also trying to recall everything I had learned last year and just trying to incoporte it in this project. 
  
  In regards to the **Engineering Design Process**, I am in Step 4 and Step 5. I have been trying to come up with the most promising solution by looking at apps for inspiration on how I want my prototype to look like after the user is able to successfully login to their account. Moving on, I will be trying to learn how I could make it possible for the user to sign in and from there on, be able to add the amount of cups of water they have drank already. I will also be focusing on what will be some of the options the user have once they sign in.
