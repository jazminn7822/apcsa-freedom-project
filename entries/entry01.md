Over the past couple of weeks, I have been trying to research different softwares or tools that I could potentially use to make an app. To back track a little bit, my primary focus as of now, is to make an app that's related to the userâ€™s health. To be specific, I would like to build an app that would have the ability to track how many cups of water the user drinks per day and hopefully by the end of the week, it would tell the user if they have accomplished their goal or not. I really want my app to be simple and straight to the point. I would only like my app to have the main points, like the "Sign in" button (which the user would have to sign in using their gmail account), the "Daily intake" and "Weekly intake" button and last but not least, the "My Goal" button.

However, inorder to even be able to do such a thing, I would need to store the users login information and the progress they are making throughout the week. Therefore, I have been doing some research on different software tools I could use to make the app and I have come across Firebase, React, Swift and others, but the one tool that caught my eye was Firebase.

Firebase is a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) built on Google infrastructure helping people create and develop iOS, Android mobile and web applications. After reading carefully through some sources like the [Firebase site](https://firebase.google.com/), I began to learn quite a few things about Firebase.
<ol>
    <li> Firebase has a a back end infrastructure which helps store users log in information. </li>
    <li> Firebase helps spread the word to get more users to download your app and helps keep the users you currently have by making sure they continue to be engaged with the app.</li>
    <li> Firebase helps you get paid if the app is successful!</li>
</ol>

Already, Firebase began to look interesting and a tool I could potentially use, so I kept researching and I came across [Firebase's documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli). As I read through the [CLI reference overview](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#install-cli-mac-linux), questions began to form in my mind. Are these commands still applicable to be me if I use a Cloud based IDE? The Overview talked about installing Firebase to a MacOS, and afterwards, running the following command `curl -sL https://firebase.tools | bash `. Right below the code it states that the "This script automatically detects your operating system, downloads the latest Firebase CLI release, then enables the globally available firebase command." My inference is that if I type this code into my IDE, then it should download everything correctly. However, I don't want to take that risk right now, so I will have to keep reading on.

Currently, in the **Engineering Design process** *(EDP)* I am at Step 1: Defining the problem and Step 2: Researching the problem. Besides researching Firebase, and asking "What is Firebase?" I've also asked myself "Will I be able to successfully learn everything I need to know to create a successful app?".

What I'm learning about Java right now in class has helped me look for answers to these questions I've asked myself. At the beginning of the year, I thought that Java was going to be a real challenge, and although it certainly is, after continously learning more about the Java, some of the **skills** I've learned are to pay close attention to detail in the code that I am writing (looking out for Syntax errors) and organize everything that I am learning into a google doc. I believe these skills will help me when finally deciding whether or not I will stick to Firebase because I will make sure to pay close attention to everything in the documentation, and actually begin tinkiring with Firebase. My way of paying close attention in the current stage that I am in is by taking down notes, so that I can continue to compare it with some of the other tools I also came across at the very beginning of my search like [React](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#overview), a JavaScript library for builiding user interfaces.

In summary, with regards to the EDP, I will have to continue doing further research on Firebase and start tinkering with it as well, so that I can decide whether or not this is the right tool for me and if not, then explore other tools before I have to settle down onto one tool and actually begin the process of brainstorming and planning the actual prototype.
